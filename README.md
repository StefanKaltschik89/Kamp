Just a quick project with temperature data from data loggers that were placed in the river kamp over the sommer months. I combined the data from the loggers with temperatiure data from an additional site at the river kamp. i retrieved this data and data on the water flow from https://www.noel.gv.at/wasserstand/#/de/Messstellen/Details/207993/Durchfluss/3Tage. 

I retrieved all files in .xlsx format, cleaned and transformed the rawdata and merged them into one file in long format.
